#Create a linked list that can be added to/removed from, either at the head or the tail
#new values generated for this list are randomly generated
#linked list is displayed to the window through connected circles that reflect the number generated through size and text written on them
#Through the display window the user can use arrow keys to navigate up, down, left or right.
#the user can also sort the linked list in ascending order.
#These circles oscilate up and down mimicking a sin wave.
#the user can adjust the amplitude of said sin wave
